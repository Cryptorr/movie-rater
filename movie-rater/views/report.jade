  h3.frtitle Motivation

      | People all over the world watch movies. In everyday life, people easily spend some hours watching series/documentaries/movies. We see that the urge for new movies is growing, but at the same time people don't want to spend their time on searching for movies that aren't even fun to watch. 
      br
      br
      | That's where our application Movie-rater comes in. People can rate, comment on every movie they want and they can also check out more information about that movie. The more users, the more functional our application becomes. Eventually, our application can reccommend movies based on your ratings. In this way, we create an application that personalizes to the user.

      | This site creates a new social network where people can share their ideas about movies and about what they like. Offcourse, the site should stay user friendly at all time, even when users interact. That's why we came up with the idea of liking comments. The most liked comments get a better position in the comment box. The amount of likes measures the amount of usefullness of the comment. In this way, we filter the comment box a little of less-contributing comments and let people read what they want to read.

      | We use The Movie Database API (
      a(href="http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/") http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/
      | ) for information we need about movies. We choose it above other movie APIs, because it has a lot of different possible calls. It extracts its data from
      a(href="https://www.themoviedb.org/")  https://www.themoviedb.org/
      | . 
      br
      br
      | By using this API, we gain information we use on each moviepage and on the homepage. In the movie page, we see a summary, genres, release-date, length, budget used for production and the companies that worked realising this movie. This is information that can appeal to a broad range of users (from action-seekers to bollywood lovers). This broad range of information also strengthened our choice for the API of themoviedb.org.

      | Our application tracks the comments and ratings that accounts make. It's stored in the mongo database. We don't track what movie pages our users visit. This is however deductible if they rate or comment on the page. We display the comments users make on each movie page, so that they can interact and discuss the movie with others. The ratings are used to calculate the average rating our users give to a movie. They are also used to recommend movies for users to watch next.

      | The lectures introduced a number of technologies we could use to build our own web application. These include html, css, jquery, javascript, python, django, the use of api's, express, node.js and more. From this list we picked the technologies we wanted to use. These are the technologies discussed in the technical architecture. So we got the basic knowledge about most of these technologies in the lectures, instructions and exercises. Then we deepened the knowledge of the technologies we had chosen a...(line truncated)...
